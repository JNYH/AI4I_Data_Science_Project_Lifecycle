AI4I-6-Q: Unsupervised Learning Quiz

1. What are the main drawbacks when using dimension reduction techniques on your data?
Some information is lost, possibly degrading the performance of the subsequent ML algorithms
Transformed features are hard to interpret
It can be computationally expensive
It adds complexity to your ML pipelines
All of the above <-answer


2. Imagine performing PCA on a 1000 dimension dataset and you set the explained variance to 95%. How many dimensions will the resulting dataset have?
Either 2 or 3 dimensions
The dataset cannot be reduced
Trick Question! Depends on the dataset <-answer


3. How should you NOT select the optimum number of clusters k in a K-Means Clustering technique?
a) Plot inertia vs number of clusters and try to identify the ‘elbow joint’
b) Look at the loss value for each of the k values and select the one with the lowest loss
c) Plot the silhouette score against the number of cluster. The optimum k value should be near the peak
B only <-answer


4. Complete the code snippet below to perform hierarchical clustering on the dataset. Assume that scipy.cluster has been imported for you.
my_cluster = [Blank](dataset, method='complete')
hierarchy.linkage <-answer
linkage
agglomerative
hierarchy


5. Which statement about Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is not true?
It is a dimension reduction technique
NMF models are easy to interpret
NMF can hand handle real numbers as input features <-answer
None of the above
