Create a notebook in Google Colaboratory. Install and import Tensorflow 2.0 and the required libraries. Load the MNIST_fashion dataset. What is the width of each picture in pixels?

The width of each picture is 
28
 px.

Build a CNN to classifiy the different classes in the dataset. Use what you learnt about convolution layers, activation functions, and dropout.

What activation should you use in the final layer?

softmax
 should be used in the final activation layer.

What is the next step after the forward pass when you are training a neural network? (Hint: You only need to answer with one word)

The next step is 
backpropagation
.

If you have a high training accuracy but a low validation accuracy, what is likely to be happening? (Hint: You only need to answer with one word)

This is 
overfitting
.

Fill in the blank.

When using gradient descent, we try to get as close to the 
global
 minima as possible (Hint: You only need to answer with one word)
